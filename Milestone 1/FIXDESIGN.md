#FIX DESIGN

## Actions suggested by Professor

1. Motivate ideal time in the problem statement
2. Provide a more high-level representation of the architecture.
3. Provide design patterns used in the project.

## The changes made


### Problem Statement

In engineering, agile methodologies often require frequent meetings in: daily scrums, sprint planning, backlog grooming, retrospects, sprint close-outs, demos as well as ad-hoc planning, designing, and training meetings etc. Meetings are an effective method for gathering different perspectives and discussing possible solutions. This involves scheduling and organizing team meetings which incur monetary expenses in some cases, and consensus of the team members about the location, start time, and the duration of the meeting. Though it seems a trivial task, it may cost resources whose overhead may exceeds the merit of meeting itself. Also, it is important that the timing of the meeting is ideal. Ideal time is subjective, but most studies have found that meetings held on weekdays other than Monday and Friday are effective. This is because of their proximity to the weekend. Also, people are found to be comfortable and enthusiastic about meetings held at 3pm as it is not early in the morning or not right after a meal. This gives employees enough time to prep for the meeting, and not be sluggish as its not after a meal. A meeting during the lunch time is also fine as long as meeting offers some kind of food refreshments. Coming to the to the significance of consensus within the team about a time, it can be exemplified by an exampleFor example,; iIn a team of 5 people, only one person may disagree at the start time of the meeting. But having a significant and equal role in the project, the members have to reschedule the meeting.  Now, supposing everyone is busy with their work, they take more time searching for another available time and location. When they find one, say two more people are not comfortable with the location! The process continues and in the interim they waste their time and needlessly procrastinate the meeting, which in turn hinders the product development. Even when they are able to concert, it may not be on the optimal terms which further decreases their productivity and efficiency of the meeting.
### Design Sketches
##### 1. Storyboard
A storyboard is a graphic organizer in the form of illustrations or images displayed in sequence for the purpose of understanding the problem and its solution. Our main focus for developing this bot is to address the problem of bad meeting timings which persist in industry for long time. To avoid such conflicts and improve efficiency, business often keep meetings when their employees are more productivity. 
Below storyboard will describe the story about the meeting bot which will schedule a meeting by taking into consideration all the factors (project cost, work efficiency and productivity of the employees).<br>
